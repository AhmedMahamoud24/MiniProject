- Express server setup with CRUD routes for a Fruits collection.
- EJS Templates for fruit operations.

**How to Run:**  
1. Install Node.js.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run: `npm install`.
3. Start the server: `node index.js`.
4. Access via: `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Mini-Project 4

**Description:**  
This iteration introduces improvements to our Express server focusing on asynchronous operations.

**Key Changes:**  
- Asynchronous handling for fetching and adding fruits.
- Improved error handling in routes.

**How to Run:**  
1. Install Node.js.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run: `npm install`.

- Version control through GitHub.

**How to Run:**  
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using: `npm install`.
4. Start the React app: `npm start`.
5. Access via: `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Mini-Project 6: React Exercise Manager

**Description:**
