# Fruits API Refactoring

- In my Miniproject4, I refactor the existing code for a simple "Fruits" API to use Promises and async/await. The code is written in JavaScript and utilizes the Express.js framework. The goal of this refactoring is to make the code more readable and maintainable by using asynchronous functions and Promises.
