# Fruits API Refactoring

- In my Miniproject4, I refactor the existing code for a simple "Fruits" API to use Promises and async/await. The code is written in JavaScript and utilizes the Express.js framework. The goal of this refactoring is to make the code more readable and maintainable by using asynchronous functions and Promises.

# MiniProject5
# Fruits List App
- This React application fetches a list of fruits from a local API and displays them on the page. It allows users to refresh the fruits list with a button.
- I basically opened a React aplication in Folder which already contains MiniProject4
- To check my react app its in Folder mini-projec-t5 ---> App.js
